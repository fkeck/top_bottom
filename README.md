# Code and data for the paper

This repository provides R code and data to reproduce results and figures from the paper:

**Assessing responses of micro-eukaryotes biodiversity to the Great Acceleration: a paleolimnological view based on sedimentary DNA.**

Fran√ßois Keck, Laurent Millet, Didier Debroas, David Etienne, Didier Galop and Isabelle Domaizon


## Analyses

Scripts can be found in the `/R` directory. They are organized in separated modules but all the analyses can be ran from the master script `RUN_Main.R`.
Once the analyses are completed, a report of the main results and figures can be generated from `Rmd/results_report.Rmd`.
Supplementary materials can be generated from `Rmd/supplementary_info.Rmd`.

## Dependencies
